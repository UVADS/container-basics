# Working with Containers in Data Science

How to set up, configure, and work with `git` and GitHub in the practice of data science.

## What is a container?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)</sup>
