## What is a Container?

A container is a standardized, self-contained environment that packages an application and all its dependencies, allowing it to run reliably on different systems. It's a lightweight, portable unit of software that's easy to deploy and manage. 

## What is Docker?

> **Docker** is a company that made the creation and use of containers easy and manageable for developers. While they did not invent the notion of the container, they popularized it with the launch of the Docker engine in 2013. Docker is a for-profit PaaS company that significantly helped standardize the container runtime.

## Containers in Data Science

Data aggregation, cleaning, pipelines and ML models all rely on software in order to operate. Responsible software management depends on well-managed code, versioning, prioritizing bugs, features, and user issues. Working at scale, modern platforms and infrastructure tend to require code-driven tests, builds, deployments, and management. Code can be used to define all the layers of effort across teams of engineers and data scientists.

Which is to say: Code is fundamental to our work, and it would be risky, inefficient, and impractical not to use source control.
