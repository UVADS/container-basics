Below are some of the most common, foundational commands for working with containers. These assume you have Docker installed on your local workstation. However, Podman and other tools provide identical functionality.

## 1. `docker pull`

This command pulls a pre-made image from a container registry, such as Docker Hub or GHCR, etc. However, you are not required to pull an image before using it; `docker run` will pull any necessary images.

Example:
```bash
docker pull pytorch/pytorch
```

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/uvarc/id-generator:latest
```

## 2. `docker images`

List all container images pulled to the local environment with this command. The output lists containers, in order by most-recent pull. Each container has an a name, a tag, an image ID, a created date, and its size.

```bash
$ docker images

REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
site                         latest    b46e2764b4c9   5 hours ago    1.59GB
ghcr.io/uvarc/id-generator   1.28      59baec9d466f   8 months ago   1.55GB
pytorch/pytorch              latest    11691e035a36   5 months ago   11.70GB
```

To remove an image, use the `docker rmi` command. This can also be forced with the `--force/-f` flag:

```bash
docker rmi --force 11691e035a36
```

**About Image Names:Tags**
Container images can be assigned names and tags when built or at any point after they exist. Container **names** can be arbitrary if you are building and running the images locally. Or, if the aim is to build a container and push it to a registry for use elsewhere, you must follow that registry's naming conventions. 
<br /><br />
In the case of Docker Hub, the name should be `<account>/<image-name>:<tag>`. For other registries, prepend with the domain to the registry; for GHCR, an example might be `ghcr.io/<account-or-org>/<image-name>:<tag>`
<br /><br />
**Tags** If no tag is assigned to an image you build, the assumed tag is called `latest`. However, the developer can easily manage tagging manually or using automation. Some useful tags might be a version number `1.3`, or a `dev` tag. 

## 3. `docker tag`

Find the `IMAGE ID` of a container image and you can assign it other tags. Below we pull the `nginx` container, find its ID, and assign it an additional name and tag:

```bash
$ docker pull nginx
```

Find the ID:

```bash
$ docker images

REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
nginx                        latest    6784fb0834aa   8 weeks ago    281MB
```

Now we `name:tag` as needed:
```bash
$ docker tag 6784f ghcr.io/uvads/nginx:special
$ docker images

REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ghcr.io/uvads/nginx          special   6784fb0834aa   8 weeks ago    281MB
nginx                        latest    6784fb0834aa   8 weeks ago    281MB
```
Notice that a new image appears in the listing, but has the same ID, same created date, and same size. Think of naming and tagging as aliases to a container ID.

**Image and Container IDs** Notice that in all examples in this site, most all commands do not require the full ID in order to identify an image or running container. Generally the first 4-5 characters will suffice to uniquely identify your target.
<br /><br />
Be aware that you can also tab-complete any container name or ID.

## 4. `docker run`

This is one of the most common commands. There are two modes to run a container in:

### A. Detached Mode

Starts the container in its own separate process.

```bash
docker run -d nginx
```

Containers that run in detached mode are usually written with that in mind, with a default service or script set to run by default (called the `ENTRYPOINT`).

- - -

### B. Interactive mode

Starts the container as if it were a true TTY session.

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

When running a container in interactive mode, no `ENTRYPOINT` service
or script are defined, so the user must provide one. In the example above, the `ubuntu` image will run with a `bash` prompt.

Any other command can be provided. Bu the session will only last as long as that command is sustained.

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/date
```
- - -

Each mode is useful in a different way. For instance, if you are running a containerized service such as an API or database, it would be preferable to spin it up in detached mode and then use it as an endpoint to connect to.

However, interactive mode can be useful when the developer needs direct access to the software and environment within the container to do their work. [Devcontainers](../docs/use-cases.md) are an advanced example of this.

You will see more examples of both modes throughout this site.

## 5. `docker ps`

This command shows all running containers on the host machine, much like the Linux `ps` command. The output shows what image was used to create each container, how long it has been running, any exposed ports, and (most importantly) a container ID.

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
e74a238ce9d3   nginx                             "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   2 seconds ago   Up 42 seconds  80/tcp                   exciting_thompson
7a28a7876a81   ghcr.io/uvarc/id-generator:1.28   "/start.sh"              23 hours ago    Up 23 hours    0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   reverent_mestorf
```

Above you can see that two containers are currently running. Each has a unique CONTAINER ID and is given an arbitrary name by the Docker engine (i.e. `exciting_thompson`, `reverent_mestorf`). Use either of these handles when issuing commands against a specific container.

## 6. `docker exec`

Docker `exec` enables the execution of additional commands against already-running containers. In this way the developer can run a second process on top of the process already threaded. The most common use case for this command is to "shell into" the container via a TTY session. (Many developers call this "hopping into a container" though it is not a true SSH or TTY session)

With a known running container name or ID, run the command. `exec` is usually used with the `-it` flags, and the path to the desired process must be added at the end.

Here we will `exec` into the `nginx` container via the `bash` shell:

```bash
docker exec -it e74a /bin/bash
```

Think of `docker exec` as similar to `docker run -it`.

## 7. `docker logs`

If you need to observe the log output of a container, or tail it in real-time, `docker logs` is your friend:

```bash
docker logs e74a
```

```bash
docker logs --follow e74a
```

## 8. `docker stop`

Stop a container using this command, with the container name or ID:

```bash
docker stop e74a
```

## 9.  `docker rm`
 
Containers, even after stopped, are still available in a cached state on the local machine. This means that any container could be brought back using `docker start e74a`.

Or, if you are completely done with a container and want to clean up all traces of it, use `docker rm e74a` to destroy the container completely.

{: .warning :}
It is important to remember that when **cloning** or **forking** an existing repository.
